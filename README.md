# Atlas The Fox. 
This is a very sad place. Kind of a graveyard for my dearest child and friend to rest at. Since that is yet another thing I wasn't able to provide to him...\
I don't believe in afterlife of any kind, at least not for humans. But still the pain for him is so excruciating, I can't help it but hope there _is_ a place. At least for a time being. Where he could make some friends, enjoy life in its best form. Life which I utterly failed, robbed from him. Before he meets eternal oblivion.
